    <h1>🎸Rock n Roll</h1>
    <h2>Where the Noise Got Cool</h2>
    <p>Rock 'n' roll blew up in the 1950s, and it was basically a musical rebellion. 
        It mixed blues, country, gospel, and rhythm & blues, then cranked up the energy. 
        It wasn’t just a sound—it was a whole movement. Youth culture, wild dancing, and that “we do what we want” attitude.</p>
    <h2>The Birth of Rock (1950s)</h2>
    <p>Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis Presley. These were the OGs. Guitars got electric, drum beats got punchy, 
        and lyrics started talking about cars, love, and breaking rules. It was fresh, fast, and parents were not ready.</p>
    <h2>The '60s – Evolution & Revolution</h2>  
    <p>Now it gets deep. Rock splits into different styles—British Invasion hits with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Who. 
        Lyrics get smarter, instruments get experimental, and bands start pushing boundaries.
        Also—Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and The Doors bring that psychedelic flavor. 
        Rock starts to mean more than just catchy tunes—it becomes about expression.</p> 
    <h2>The '70s – Big Hair, Big Sound</h2>
    <p>The ‘70s was rock on steroids. Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Queen, AC/DC—legends. 
        We got hard rock, prog rock, glam rock... and it’s all massive. Stadium shows, guitar solos, epic vibes.
        This is also when punk rock shows up—short, raw, and in your face. The Ramones, Sex Pistols, 
        and The Clash weren’t here to be pretty—they came to scream truth.</p>
    <h2>The '80s – Flashy, Loud & Proud</h2>
    <p>Rock gets a makeover. It’s glitzy and high-energy. Hello hair metal: Guns N’ Roses, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard. Also, MTV launches, 
        so music videos blow up, and rock stars become style icons.
        Meanwhile, alternative rock starts bubbling under—think The Cure, R.E.M., setting the stage for the next wave.</p>
    <h2>The '90s – Grunge & Alt-Rock Take Over</h2>
    <p>This decade? Total mood shift. Out with the glam, in with the flannel and angst. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, 
        Soundgarden lead the grunge movement. Real, raw, and emotional.
        Then Radiohead, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Green Day, and Smashing Pumpkins take alternative and punk to new places.</p> 
    <h2>2000s to Now – Genre-Bending & Revival</h2>   
    <p>Modern rock is all over the place—in a good way. Some bands keep the old-school sound alive 
        (The Killers, Arctic Monkeys, Foo Fighters), while others blend in pop, electronic, even hip-hop vibes.
        And indie rock? Huge. Tame Impala, Imagine Dragons, Paramore, Måneskin, and more are keeping the fire going with fresh twists.</p>  
    <h2>So What’s Rock 'n' Roll Really About?</h2>  
    <p>It’s about freedom. Making noise. Saying what you feel—even if it’s messy. Rock 'n' roll is a guitar riff, a scream, a vibe, a moment. 
        It’s gone through a thousand changes, but the soul of it? Still beats hard.</p>
